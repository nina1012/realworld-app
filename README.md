# ![RealWorld Example App](./public/logo.png)

## Project Description üìñ

Conduit is a social blogging site (i.e. a Medium.com clone). It uses a custom API for all requests, including authentication.
This codebase was created to demonstrate a frontend application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

Simply log in with these credentials to start using the application. üöÄ

## Important Notice ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Please note:** The app may not render or function correctly if the API (https://api.realworld.io/api/) is down or experiencing issues. This could affect features such as user authentication, data fetching, and any dynamic content relying on the backend. To demonstrate the functionality of the application, I have included several demo Articles and Tags. These are designed to showcase the core features of the app, even if the API is not working properly or is unavailable.

If you encounter problems:

1. Try refreshing the page.
2. Check if the API service is available.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

**Additional Note:** `dashboard.cy.ts` tests have been temporarily commented out in the workflow due to their dependency on the API, which is currently unstable (as of October 26th). This allows other tests to proceed until the API is reliable.
